## Introducing, Crimsen
Crimsen is a period tracking app designed to be inclusive of the experiences of queer women and trans/non-binary people who experience menstruation.

Our product website and wireframes were built within a matter of hours at [BuildHer 2017](http://buildher.io/), and we won the award for [Best Interdiscliplinary Hack](https://devpost.com/software/crimsen)!

*Post-hackathon edits:*
* Updated the ReadME
* Updated wireframe and logo image files
* Replaced wireframe border with box-shadow

Other than minor aesthetic changes, we plan to leave the prototype untouched as a record of what we accomplished in a short time üëçüèΩ
